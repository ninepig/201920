第1轮：（1）merge two sorted list, do it in place; (2) in place去除重复的char，后面补0; (3) given a function random(), which will return true or false at random. Implement randomInt() which calls random() internally.
第2轮：given a list of chars, find all the possible words that are in the given dictionary. analyze time complexity and space complexity
第3轮：given an array of sorted distinct integers while we can’t get its size, find the index of the target number and return its index, if not found, return -1
第4轮：system design, rate limiter
第5轮：calculate the number of click times in the last x minutes. implement click(delta), get_clicks(x_minutes). Follow up: if we keep adding more clicks, memory usage will go up. How do we deal with this? (We can delete clicks that happen 1 day ago
